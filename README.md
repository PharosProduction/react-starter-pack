# React Starter Pack on Next.JS

React Starter Pack is prepared by [Pharos Production Inc.](https://pharosproduction.com) team.

This is a (relatively) unopinionated minimalist starter pack for React app development. App is prepared using Next.JS, Styled Components and their friends.

## Getting started

Clone this repo in a directory of your choosing, but get rid of the `.git` metadata folders and init a clean repo for your own project. Easier yet, you can download this repo as a zip file from Github. Once you're set up, `cd` into the repo's directory and install node packages:

`npm install`

This will install all the packages listed in `package.json`, which are needed for building assets.

## Running the app

There are 3 commands in `package.json`, you can use them for:
1. `npm run dev`: run app in the development mode;
2. `npm run build`: build the app's package in PRODUCTION mode;
3. `npm start`: start the app in PRODUCTION mode.
